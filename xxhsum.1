.SH "NAME"
\fBxxhsum\fR \- print or check xxHash checksums
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBxxhsum\fR [\fIOPTION\fR] \.\.\. [\fIFILE\fR] \.\.\.
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Print or check xxHash (32 or 64bit) checksums\. When \fIFILE\fR is \fB\-\fR, read standard input\.
.
.P
\fBxxhsum\fR supports a command line syntax similar but not indentical to md5sum(1)\. Differences are: \fBxxhsum\fR doesn\'t have text/binary mode switch; \fBxxhsum\fR always treats file as binary file; \fBxxhsum\fR have hash bit width switch (\fB\-H\fR)\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-check\fR
Read xxHash sums from the \fIFILE\fRs and check them
.
.TP
\fB\-H\fR\fIHASHTYPE\fR
Hash selection\. \fIHASHTYPE\fR means \fB0\fR=32bits, \fB1\fR=64bits\. Default value is \fB1\fR (64bits)
.
.P
The following four options are useful only when verifying checksums (\fB\-c\fR)
.
.TP
\fB\-\-strict\fR
Don\'t print OK for each successfully verified file
.
.TP
\fB\-\-status\fR
Don\'t output anything, status code shows success
.
.TP
\fB\-\-quiet\fR
Exit non\-zero for improperly formatted checksum lines
.
.TP
\fB\-\-warn\fR
Warn about improperly formatted checksum lines
